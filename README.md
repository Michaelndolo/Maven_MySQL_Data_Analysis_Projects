### Overview
---

In this series, I played the role of a business owner who just acquired Maven Movies, a brick and mortar DVD rental shop. Using MysQL database, my job was to learn everything I could about my new business, including inventory, staff, and customer behaviour.

### Data Sources
---

Database: The primary database used for this analysis is the file titled "create_mavenmovies" file, containing all the code for all the tables used throughout this project series. The mavenmovies database contained 16 related tables about customers, business and inventory.

### Tools and Frameworks
---

- Mysql Workbench - Data querying and Analysis

### Summary
---

The project began with a quick intro to the SQL language, addressing some key database fundamentals, and using MySQL to select, filter, sort and group data from individual tables. From there I shifted into more complex use cases, and blended data across multiple tables with JOIN queries.

Skills applied; database normalization and cardinality, The "SQL big 6", multi-table querying, CASE & COUNT statements, Subqueries, Bridging of unrelated tables, Union Operator among others.
